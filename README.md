## How to Build v2.1 Goal

### Material for Two Goals

#### Steel Pipes and Rods
- 4x [Steel Round Pipe 51.0 x 2.6 x 2000 mm](https://www.stahl-shop24.de/Stahl-Rundrohr-51-0x2-6mm-2000mm)
- 4x [Steel Round Pipe 51.0 x 2.6 x 1500 mm](https://www.stahl-shop24.de/Stahl-Rundrohr-51-0x2-6mm-1500mm)
- 5x [Steel Round Pipe 44.5 x 2.6 x 1500 mm](https://www.stahl-shop24.de/Stahl-Rundrohr-44-5x2-6mm-1500mm)
- 4x [Steel Rod 10 x 2000 mm](https://www.stahl-shop24.de/Rundstahl-10mm-2000mm)
- 4x [Steel Rod 10 x 1500 mm](https://www.stahl-shop24.de/Rundstahl-10mm-1500mm)

Links go to [Stahl-Shop24](https://www.stahl-shop24.de/) where I bought the pipes and rods for our goals. No shipping costs charged when you get it all there (because over 150€ it is free in Germany). Worked out well for me. In other countries, you might need to find other suppliers.

#### Other Parts
- 128 x M10 Steel Nuts or 80 x M10 Steel Nuts and 48 x M10 Welding Nuts
- 48 x M10 x 10 Staneless Steel Point Set Screws [like](https://www.amazon.de/Gewindestifte-Innensechskant-Spitze-M10x10-Edelstahl/dp/B08KTR164Y/ref=sr_1_20?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=37JKSHVMMZ3GD&keywords=madenschrauben+m10x10&qid=1677685621&sprefix=madenschrauben+m10x10%2Caps%2C130&sr=8-20)

#### Tools
- Welder like MIG/MAG and everything you need to operate it
- Metal Cutting Saw
- angle grinder
- Grinding and cutting disks
- Metal brush
- Handheld metal tools
- Inbus for M10 Point Set Screw
- minimum 11mm Drill Bit and Countersink or step drill bit with minimum 11 mm diameter stage
- drilling machine (drill press recommended)
- gloves

#### Paint-Job
- 2k high quality red paint
- ground paint
- painting tools

### Instructions

#### Parts Preparation

For cutting metal pipes and rods a metal cutting circular saw is recommended. Using this saw rather than an angle grinder guarantees clear cuts as you can see on the picture below.

Use the cutting pattern sheets for [inner pipes](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v2.1-Disassemblable/blob/main/Cutting_Pattern_Inner_Poles_v2.1.pdf) ,[outer pipes and rods](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v2.1-Disassemblable/blob/main/Cutting_Pattern_Outer_Poles_v2.1.pdf) cutting to length.

Put a line of tape on each pipe and rod and mark them to make finding the right parts easier.

Drill 11 mm holes and countersink them where the clamping nuts are welded on later. Using drilling oil is recommended. The holes are located where the set screews go through the outer pipes to clamp the inner pipes. The countersink makes placing the nuts easier for welding them on the pipes. When you use special M10 welding nuts the countersink might be redundant. You can find the dimensions and the angles for drilling the holes on the drawing sheets for the three parts and their mirrored counter parts (make shure you get all the angles right):

- [Top Corner](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v2.1-Disassemblable/blob/main/Top_Corner_Drawing_v2.1.pdf)
- [Base Corner](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v2.1-Disassemblable/blob/main/Base_Corner_Drawing_v2.1.pdf)
- [Base Back](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v2.1-Disassemblable/blob/main/Base_Back_Drawing_v2.1.pdf)

Clean all the welding areas with a angle grinder and a grinding disk. On some edged that are supposed to be welded to corners it might be necessary to grind a small chamfer on. Ask your skilled welder friend for advise (see explanation below).

#### Welding

I don't know how to weld. If you are as bad at welding as I am, have an experienced friend do this part. Welders know how this has to be done. Please use the part drawings mentioned above.

<img src="https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v2.1-Disassemblable/blob/main/assets/skilled_friend.JPG" width=80% height=80%>

Following I will try to sum up some recommendations:

First weld all 90° corners, then the 123° one. Clean up the weld seams with a angle grinder and a grinding disk.

When you don´t have magnetic square clamps by hand better build your own jig to make shure the pipes are in the right angle when weld together. For the 123° corner a self-build jig is anyway recommended.

Then weld on the clamping nuts. Better let screews inside when welding. Minium weld on three points on a hex nut, better all six sides. But be carefull, don´t weld to long, the nut could distored due to too much heat. When using a four-sided welding nut point-weld all four sides.

After welding on the clamping nuts prepare the rods. Put the nuts on the rod and place it on a plane to align the nuts. Use the drawings again to adjust the spacing between the nuts and to see how much nuts are needed. On both ends on each rod the end of the rod should be 2mm into the nut (better for welding I hope). Weld all nuts to the rod to secure the nuts in place.

Then weld on the prepared rods onto the pipes (on two sides of the nuts on the rods). Please make shure to match the right angles around the inner axis of the pipes as shown in the drawings.

#### Painting

Apply paint is almost my worst discipline so I cannot give good advice at this topic. I´ve used a 1k all in one paint with primer function and rust protection build in. It is realy crappy. Better use 2k high quality paint (maybe car grade quality) and use proper primer. For sure the metal needs to be cleaned from oil realy well befor applyin the primer. Use proper detergents. Better apply more than one coat of paint and let dry it sufficient.

I haven´t painted the inner pipes. Make sure they are still oiled sufficient to prevent rust.

#### Assembly

Put the inner pipes into the outer pipes parts and fix them by clamping with the set screews. In first assembly I recommend to make marks on the inner pipes where the junction area is. This makes later set up easier. Place the inner pipes so that all 4 screws at each junction are clamping. Do not tighten the set screews to firmly to prevent damage to the screews by the inbus bits.

List of junctions and inner pipes length:

- Top Corner Right and Left: 700 mm (equal distributed)
- Top Corner and Base Corner: 750 mm (not equal distributed)
- Base Corner and Base Back: 650 mm (eqaul distributed)

## Safety Advise

Please make shure your final build has no sharp edges to prevent inusries while using the goals on the field.

## Case

I´ve planned to build a case to make goal transport and storage even more easier. The case is not build and tested yet. The dimesions would be like 1100 mm x 900 mm. There should be two roles on two corners and handles on three sides.

(possible breakdown pattern for parts in case)

## How to Contribute

Feedback is very much appreciated. After building v2.0 I made some changes to the design and I really need feedback of how they worked out in  building to verify the current design state. Please let me know if you build v2.1 and send me a mail to @github@dlaxv.de. I would also love to see some pictures of your builds!

If you want to make changes to design by your own to make it better or adjust it to your needs feel free to use the [.step](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v2.1-Disassemblable/blob/main/FIL_Goal_v2.1.step) or [f3s](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v2.1-Disassemblable/blob/main/FIL_Goal_v2.1.f3d) (Fusion 360) files. Please be warned, the model got mad somehow in the process when I tinkered around with components. Hopefully I can repair it in the future.


## History

### v2.1 Update

- adjusted and modified some angles and dimensions and re-build it in Fusion 360
- changed M8 Nuts and Screws to M10 (nuts distorted due to welding)
- changed M12 Nuts to M10 (to have only M10 nuts)
- changed from Staneless Steel Nuts to normal Steel Nuts (welding of the different materials was difficult, much rework)
- rigid installtion of the rods (former rods had threats on both ends and where held by nuts, a way too much work cutting all the threads by hand)

### v2.0 Re-Design of the v1.0 goal by ChangeD20

- Split bar for smaler parts -> much better transportable
- Smaller screws
- Test-build it


### v1.0 First Goal [Drawings by Dresden Lacrosse](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v1.0-Disassemblable-Rigid-Bar) with a rigid bar

- Disassemblable -> easier transportable as an rigid goal
