## How to Build v2.1 Goal

### Material for Two Goals

#### Steel Pipes and Rods
- 4x [Steel Round Pipe 51.0 x 2.6 x 2000 mm](https://www.stahl-shop24.de/Stahl-Rundrohr-51-0x2-6mm-2000mm)
- 4x [Steel Round Pipe 51.0 x 2.6 x 1500 mm](https://www.stahl-shop24.de/Stahl-Rundrohr-51-0x2-6mm-1500mm)
- 5x [Steel Round Pipe 44.5 x 2.6 x 1500 mm](https://www.stahl-shop24.de/Stahl-Rundrohr-44-5x2-6mm-1500mm)
- 4x [Steel Rod 10 x 2000 mm](https://www.stahl-shop24.de/Rundstahl-10mm-2000mm)
- 4x [Steel Rod 10 x 1500 mm](https://www.stahl-shop24.de/Rundstahl-10mm-1500mm)

Links go to [Stahl-Shop24](https://www.stahl-shop24.de/) where I bought the pipes and rods for our goals. No shipping costs charged when you get it all there (because over 150€ it is free). Worked out well for me.

#### Other Parts
- 128 x M10 Steel Nuts or 80 x M10 Steel Nuts and 48 x M10 Welding Nuts
- 48 x M10 x 10 Staneless Steel Point Set Screws [like](https://www.amazon.de/Gewindestifte-Innensechskant-Spitze-M10x10-Edelstahl/dp/B08KTR164Y/ref=sr_1_20?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=37JKSHVMMZ3GD&keywords=madenschrauben+m10x10&qid=1677685621&sprefix=madenschrauben+m10x10%2Caps%2C130&sr=8-20)

#### Tools
- Welder like MIG/MAG and everything you need to operate it
- Metal Cutting Saw
- angle grinder
- Grinding and cutting disks
- Metal brush
- Handheld metal tools
- Inbus for M10 Point Set Screw
- minimum 11mm Drill Bit and Countersink or step drill bit with minimum 11 mm diameter stage
- drilling machine (drill press recomanded)

#### Paint-Job
- 2k high quality red paint
- ground paint
- painting tools

### Instructions

#### Parts Preparation

For cutting metal pipes and rods a metal cutting curcular saw is recommended.

Use the cutting pattern sheets for [inner pipes](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v2.1-Disassemblable/blob/main/Cutting_Pattern_Inner_Poles_v2.1.pdf) ,[outer pipes and rods](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v2.1-Disassemblable/blob/main/Cutting_Pattern_Outer_Poles_v2.1.pdf) cutting to length.

Put a line of tape on each pipe and rod and mark them to make finding the right parts easier.

Drill 11 mm holes and countersink them where the clamping nuts are welded on later. The holes are located where the set screews go through the outer pipes to clamp the inner pipes. The countersink makes placing the nuts easier for welding them on the pipes. When you use special M10 welding nuts the countersink might be redundant. You can find the dimensions and the angles for drilling the holes on the drawing sheets for the three parts and their mirrored counter parts (make shure you get all the angles right):

- [Base Corner](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v2.1-Disassemblable/blob/main/Base_Corner_Drawing_v2.1.pdf)
- [Base Back](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v2.1-Disassemblable/blob/main/Base_Back_Drawing_v2.1.pdf)

Clean up all the welding areas with a angle grinder and a grinding disk.

#### Welding

I don't know how to weld. If you are as bad at welding as I am, have an experienced friend do this part. Welders know how this has to be done. Please use the part drawings mentioned above.

Following I will try to sum up some recommendations:

First weld all 90° corners, then the 123° one. Clean up the weld seams with a angle grinder and a grinding disk.

When you don´t have magnetic square clamps by hand better build your own jig to make shure the pipes are in the right angle when weld together. For the 123° corner a self-build jig is anyway recommended.

Then weld on the clamping nuts. Better let screews inside when welding. Minium weld on three points on a hex nut, better all six sides. But be carefull, don´t weld to long, the nut could distored due to too much heat. When using a four-sided welding nut point-weld all four sides.

After welding on the clamping nuts prepare the rods. Put the nuts on the rod and place it on a plane to align the nuts. Use the drawings again to adjust the spacing between the nuts and to see how much nuts are needed. On both ends on each rod the end of the rod should be 2mm into the nut (better for welding I hope). Weld all nuts to the rod to secure the nuts in place.

Then weld on the prepared rods onto the pipes (on two sides of the nuts on the rods). Please make shure to match the right angles around the inner axis of the pipes as shown in the drawings.










## Case

I´ve planned to build a case to make goal transport and storage even more easier. The case is not ready yet. The dimesions would be like 1100 mm x 900 mm. There should be two roles on two corners and handles on three sides.

## History

### v2.1 Update

- adjusted and modified some angles and and dimensions and re-build it in Fusion 360
- changed M8 Nuts and Screws to M10 (nuts distorted due to welding)
- changed M12 Nuts to M10 (to have only M10 nuts)
- changed from Staneless Steel Nuts to normal Steel Nuts (welding of the different materials was difficult, much rework) 

### v2.0 Re-Design of the v1.0 goal by ChangeD20

- Split bar for smaler parts -> much better transportable
- Smaller screws
- Test-build it


### v1.0 First Goal [Drawings by Dresden Lacrosse](https://github.com/DLaxV-Community-Projects-Hub/FIL-Box-Lacrosse-Goal-v1.0-Disassemblable-Rigid-Bar) with a rigid bar

- Disassemblable -> easier transportable as an rigid goal
